# Solar System Simulation in Three.js

This project is a simulation of our Solar System created using Three.js. It includes representations of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, each orbiting the Sun with real-time updates and controls for user interaction.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Provides a 3D model of the Solar System.
- **Orbit Controls**: Allows users to interact with the simulation using mouse controls.
- **Real-time Animation**: Simulates the orbiting motion of the planets around the Sun.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to window resizing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for setting up a local server if needed)
- A modern web browser that supports WebGL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-system-simulation.git
    cd solar-system-simulation
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the local server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Running the Simulation

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL provided by your local server). The simulation should load and display the Solar System.
